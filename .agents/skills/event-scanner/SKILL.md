# Event Scanner

Use this skill when the user wants event suggestions or asks what's happening in their area. It discovers real events from configured sources, scores them against the user's taste profile, and returns a ranked shortlist with source links and caveats.

## Procedure

1. Follow the boot sequence in `.agents/skills/event-scanner/references/operating-model.md`.
2. Create a new empty run note in `.agents/skills/event-scanner/runs/` before discovery starts.
3. Add `event-scanner` to the run note's `Skills used` list immediately.
4. Apply these pipeline steps in order:
   - `.agents/skills/event-scanner/steps/step-1-discovery.md`
   - `.agents/skills/event-scanner/steps/step-2-scoring.md`
   - `.agents/skills/event-scanner/steps/step-3-calendar-review.md`
   - `.agents/skills/event-scanner/steps/step-4-shortlist-review.md`
5. Produce the ranked shortlist.

For explicit requests to add a specific suggested event to Google Calendar, follow `.agents/skills/event-scanner/steps/step-5-add-to-calendar.md`.

Read and write only within this skill's folder.
